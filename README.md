# Muffins
Various procedural and algorithmic programs to help solve cases of the Muffin problem

## Setup/Prerequisites
1. Must be using Python 3
2. Pulp library installed (`pip install pulp`)
3. Sympy library installed (`pip install sympy`)


## Important Files

### fms.py - named for f(m,s)
Run this program to find the upper bound for f(m,s).

For example: `python fms.py 5 3` will return the upper bound of f(5, 3) and the method used to find it.

For ranges of values, for instance 10 < m < 21 and 4 < s < 11:

`python fms.py 11 20 5 10`

### procedures.py
Run this program to find the whether a procedure exists for cutting m muffins for s people, with the smallest piece at least a certain size, Q.

For Q generated by fms.py: `python procedures.py 5 3`

For specifying your own Q: `python procedures.py 5 3 5/12`
