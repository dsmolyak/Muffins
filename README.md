# Muffins
Various procedural and algorithmic programs to help solve cases of the Muffin problem

## Setup/Prerequisites
1. Must be using Python 3 (If Python 3 is not default, replace each occurance below of `python` with `python3` or `python36`)
2. Pulp library installed (`pip install pulp` or `pip3 install pulp`)
3. Sympy library installed (`pip install sympy` or `pip3 install sympy`)
4. Pylatex library installed (`pip install pylatex` or `pip3 install pylatex`)


## Important Files

### muf
Run this program to find the upper bound and lower bound for f(m,s).

For example: `./muf 5 3` will return the upper bound of f(5,3), the method used to find it, the lower bound of f(5,3), and the procedure used to cut m muffins for s people with the lower bound as the smallest piece.
(Replace `muf` with `muf3` or `muf36` depending on what your corresponding command is for `python`)


### diag

Run this program to generate a diagram for a proof of upper bound.

For example: `./diag 11 5` or `./diag 11 5 13/30` will return the latex code for a diagram to help prove that f(11,5) = 13/30


### fms.py - named for f(m,s)
Run this program to find the upper bound for f(m,s).

For example: `python fms.py 5 3` will return the upper bound of f(5, 3) and the method used to find it.

For ranges of values, for instance 10 < m < 21 and 4 < s < 11:

`python fms.py 11 20 5 10`

### procedures.py
Run this program to find the whether a procedure exists for cutting m muffins for s people, with the smallest piece at least a certain size, Q.

For Q generated by fms.py: `python procedures.py 5 3`

For specifying your own Q: `python procedures.py 5 3 5/12`


### bigrun.py
Run this program to generate a list of upper and lower bounds for f(m,s) in a certain range.

First, to run this program you must create a `bigrun` folder (if it doesn't exist already): `mkdir bigrun`

Then, you run `bigrun.py` with the your lower and upper bound for m and s.

For example, for ranges of values 10 < m < 21 and 4 < s < 11:

`python bigrun.py 11 20 5 10`

The resulting latex and pdfs should appear in the `bigrun` folder.
