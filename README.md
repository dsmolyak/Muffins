# Muffins
Various procedural and algorithmic programs to help solve cases of the Muffin problem

## Important Files

### fms.py
Has the function, f(m,s), which runs all of the currently available methods for finding f(m,s).
These methods include Floor-Ceiling, D1, D2, Dk1, Dk2, HALF1, HALF2, and V3 (BM).

### genAppendix.py
Creates the appendix, where all FC patterns and exceptions to those patterns are listed out.

### bigrun.py
Runs f(m,s) and tests whether there are procedures for the result, for all m and s up to a given
limit.

### MuffinsAnalysis.ipynb
Contains analysis of all of the exceptions (FC pattern does not apply) found by f(m,s). There
are some nice plots!

### Others...
All the other programs are either not in use or are dependencies for the above programs. For
instance, JacobPrograms are the programs for finding procedures and V3.
